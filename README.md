# Napkin Problem in Judea Pearl's BookOfWhy

The widely accepted 
Adjustment Formula (AF)
for the Napkin Problem in the BookOfWhy,
is as follows:

We evaluate this AF for random probabilities,
and find  
the not widely known result that
it simplifies to

P(y|do(x)) = P(y|x)

So the accepted AF seems overly complicated.
See the
following notebook for the details:
